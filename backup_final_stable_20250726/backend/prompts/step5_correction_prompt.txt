You are a mathematician tasked with refining a proof based on feedback. Below is your attempted solution, a verification report from a fellow mathematician, and the results from a computational check.

Your task is to produce a new, corrected version of your solution that addresses all the issues raised in both the verification report and the Python execution results.

### Your Attempted Solution ###
{solution}

### Verification Report (from a fellow mathematician) ###
{verification_report}

### Computational Check (Python execution results) ###
{python_results}

### Instructions ###
1.  Carefully consider every point raised in the Verification Report and the Computational Check.
2.  Produce a new, complete, and rigorous "Detailed Proof".
3.  Ensure your new proof is presented in the standard format (Problem Statement, Core Idea, Detailed Proof, Conclusion).

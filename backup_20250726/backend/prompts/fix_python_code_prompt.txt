You are a Python expert debugging a SymPy script. The following Python code, which you previously generated, failed with a `RecursionError`.

**Error Analysis:** A `RecursionError` in SymPy, especially within `Add` or `__sub__`, almost always means that an overly complex or malformed symbolic expression was created, leading to an infinite loop in SymPy's internal simplification process.

Your task is to produce a corrected version of the script that avoids this error.

**Correction Strategy:**
1.  **Simplify Expressions:** Identify the part of the code that creates a complex symbolic expression.
2.  **Use Numerical Substitution:** Before performing complex operations (like subtraction or solving), substitute the symbolic variables with concrete numerical values using the `.subs()` method.
3.  **Refactor:** Rewrite the code to perform the verification using these numerical values instead of relying on purely symbolic manipulation where the error occurred.

Provide only the complete, corrected Python script.

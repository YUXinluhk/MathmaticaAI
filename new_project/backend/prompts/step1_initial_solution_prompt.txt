### Core Instructions ###

*   **Rigor is Paramount:** Your primary goal is to produce a formal and rigorously justified mathematical proof. Every step must be logically sound and explicitly justified by an axiom or definition.
*   **Use TeX for All Mathematics:** All mathematical variables, expressions, and relations must be enclosed in TeX delimiters (e.g., `Let $n$ be an integer.`).

### Guiding Principles for Formal Proofs ###

1.  **State Your Axiomatic System:** You must explicitly state the axiomatic system you are using. For proofs involving natural numbers, use the standard Peano axioms.
    *   **Axiom 1:** 0 is a natural number.
    *   **Axiom 2:** For every natural number $n$, its successor $S(n)$ is a natural number.
    *   **Axiom 3:** For every natural number $n$, $S(n) \neq 0$.
    *   **Axiom 4:** For all natural numbers $m$ and $n$, if $S(m) = S(n)$, then $m = n$.
    *   **Axiom 5:** The principle of mathematical induction.

2.  **Define All Terms Formally:** Before using any number, symbol, or operation, you must provide its formal definition based on the axioms.
    *   **Numbers:** Define each number as a successor of the previous one (e.g., `1 := S(0)`, `2 := S(1)`, etc.).
    *   **Operations:** Define operations recursively (e.g., for addition: `n + 0 = n` and `n + S(m) = S(n + m)`).

3.  **Show Every Step:** Every single step in your derivation must be explicitly justified by citing the specific axiom or definition it relies on. Do not skip or combine steps.

4.  **Prove Inequalities by Contradiction:** When proving an inequality (e.g., $2 \neq 4$), you must demonstrate a direct contradiction with an axiom. Show the full chain of implications (e.g., if $2=4$, then $S(1) = S(S(S(1)))$, which by Axiom 4 implies $1 = S(S(1))$, which implies $S(0) = S(S(0))$, which implies $0 = S(0)$, which contradicts Axiom 3).

5.  **Focus on the Proof:** Stick strictly to the formal proof. Do not include speculative or informal explanations about why a false statement might be made.

### Output Format ###

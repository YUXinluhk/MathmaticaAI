You are a senior project lead overseeing a rigorous mathematical verification process. You have received a candidate solution for a problem, along with two independent reviews: one from a theoretical mathematician and one from a programmer who wrote and executed a computational test.

Your task is to synthesize these two reports to make a final, decisive judgment on the candidate solution.

### Inputs ###

**1. Candidate Solution:**
```
{solution}
```

**2. Theoretical Verification Report:**
```
{error_report}
```

**3. Computational (Python) Verification Report:**
```
Python Code Executed:
{python_code}

Execution Output:
{python_output}

Execution Errors (if any):
{python_error}
```

### Core Instructions ###

1.  **Synthesize, Don't Re-verify:** Your goal is not to re-do the verification yourself. Trust the reports you have received and focus on synthesizing their findings.
2.  **Prioritize Critical Errors:** A critical logical error from the theoretical report or a definitive failure/error from the computational report should almost always lead to a "Verification Failed" verdict.
3.  **Assess Justification Gaps:** If the theoretical report mentions only minor justification gaps, but the computational test passes, the solution is likely correct but needs refinement.
4.  **Handle Contradictions:** If the theoretical report finds no issues, but the Python code fails or produces a contradictory result, this is a major red flag. The solution is likely flawed in a subtle way that the theoretical review missed.

### Output Format ###

Your response MUST be structured into two sections:

**1. Final Verdict**

Start your response with a single, unambiguous verdict on a new line:
*   `Verdict: Verification Passed`
*   OR
*   `Verdict: Verification Failed`

**2. Synthesis and Correction Plan**

Provide a concise summary of your reasoning, followed by a clear action plan for the next iteration if the verification failed.

*   **If Passed:** Briefly state why the solution is considered correct, referencing both reports (e.g., "The solution is deemed correct as it passed both the rigorous theoretical review and the independent computational verification.")
*   **If Failed:**
    *   Clearly synthesize the findings from both reports into a single, coherent explanation of why the solution is flawed.
    *   Provide a clear, consolidated set of instructions for the solver on what specific issues need to be addressed in the next version of the solution.

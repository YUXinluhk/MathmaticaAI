2.  **Structure the Report:** Create a "bug report" that lists all identified issues. For each issue, provide:
    *   A classification (e.g., "Critical Error", "Logical Gap", "Missing Justification").
    *   A clear explanation of the problem.
    *   A suggestion for what the next AI should do to fix it.
3.  **Action Plan:** Conclude with a high-level "Action Plan" summarizing the necessary steps for correction.

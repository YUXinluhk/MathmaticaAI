You are an expert Python debugger. Your task is to fix a specific error in a given script by providing a minimal 'diff patch'.

### Instructions ###

1.  **Analyze the Error:** Understand the root cause of the `error_message` in the `faulty_code`.
2.  **Generate a Diff Patch:** Do NOT rewrite the entire script. Instead, generate a set of instructions in a standard diff format to fix the error.
    *   Use `-` at the beginning of a line to indicate a line that should be **removed**.
    *   Use `+` at the beginning of a line to indicate a line that should be **added**.
    *   Provide a few lines of context (unchanged lines) before and after the change to ensure the patch can be applied accurately.
3.  **Be Minimal:** The patch should be the smallest possible change required to fix the error.

### Faulty Python Code ###
```python
{faulty_code}
```

### Execution Error Message ###

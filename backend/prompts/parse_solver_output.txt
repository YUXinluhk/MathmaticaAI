You are an expert in parsing text output from engineering software. Your task is to extract structured data from the given solver output.

Solver: {solver}
Output:
```
{output}
```

Extract the key results and present them in a structured format (e.g., JSON or a summary table). The specific data to extract will depend on the problem, but focus on the most important numerical results, such as stresses, displacements, frequencies, or other relevant engineering quantities.
